#+TITLE: Posix Shell Cheat Sheet

* Basics
** Navigation
- ~cd~ :: change directory
- ~ls~ :: list contents of directory(ies), or list individual files
** File manipulation
- ~mkdir~ :: create (make) directory
- ~touch~ :: set file modification time (default to now), create file if not exists
- ~mv~ :: move/rename file (source and target must be same filesystem)
- ~cp~ :: copy file
- ~rm~ :: remove files (optionally recursively remove directories)
- ~chmod~ :: change permission mode
- ~chown~ :: change owner and group
- ~echo~ :: print something to stdout
- ~cat~ :: print file contents of each argument to stdout
- ~less~ :: read file(s) in pager (scrollable, searchable, etc)
** Finding files
- ~locate~ :: search database for a file
- ~updatedb~ :: update database with current filesystem
** Docs
- ~man~ :: lookup manual page for a command, config file, C function, etc
** Misc
- ~clear~ :: clear terminal
- ~reset~ :: reset all terminal control settings, then clear. Use if terminal is
             acting funky
* Job control
- ~jobs~ :: list backgrounded jobs
- ~bg~ :: resume stopped job in background (return prompt)
- ~fg~ :: resume stopped job in foreground
* Process control
- ~ps~ :: list running processes
- ~top~ :: monitor running processes
- ~htop~ :: better version of ~top~
- ~kill~ :: send signal (default SIGTERM (terminate)) to a process
- ~pgrep~ :: search for a process by name
- ~pkill~ :: kill a process by name
* Recon
- ~strings~ :: finds runs of printable characters that are longer than a certain
               length. Useful for finding strings embedded in programs, etc
- ~file~ :: figure out what kind of file we're looking at based on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)][Magic Numbers]]
- ~binwalk~ :: like ~file~, searches for magic numbers in a file, but this
               searches the whole file, finding files potentially hidden in the
               main file
* Network
- ~ping~ :: send ICMP Echo requests to host (see if you can reach a host,
            measure latency)
- ~ifconfig~ :: show interface (network card) configuration
- ~dig~ :: get DNS records
- ~nslookup~ :: another command to get DNS records
* C
- ~gcc~ :: GNU Compiler Collection, used to compile (and assemble and link)
           mainly C and C++
- ~gdb~ :: GNU Debugger, used to debug programs
- ~objdump~ :: Disassembles object files (compiled but not linked) and full
               binaries
