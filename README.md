# ctf-training
This is where I will put source code, compilerd binaries, and solutions for the
WCSC Reverse Engineering/Binary Exploitation meetings on Tuesdays at 5pm in ENB
313 or 337.

Tools that we use in the meetings are gdb (with [PEDA](https://github.com/longld/peda)),
objdump, [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/demo/), and
[pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools).

For the meeting on Tuesday February, 27 (and likely future meetings), we will be
using @ktrio's (Kevin Dennis's) repository [here](https://github.com/Ktrio3/ctf-training-and-challenges).
